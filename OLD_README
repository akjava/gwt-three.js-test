#GWTWrapper for Three.js

This is My GWT wrapper for three.js
Most of code is just converted form js files.
so methods was never tested there are many bugs.
I'm still not built a way to test all methods.

Stable reeleased version for three.js-r66
developed version for three.js-r69

[Bug cases]
I'll list common bug cases.
1. wrong type;sometime I misunderstand js codes.it's really difficult to recognize arg or return use Matrix3 or Matrix4 etc.
2. still raw JavaScriptObject.To use in GWT,it must be implement.I only implement object which my need.
3. instanceof problem,somecase your array don't pass instanceof check.use Thrree.createArray()
I'm going to support iterable and do it inside it.
4. lack of setter value.most of properties was initialized in constructor,so it should not be replaced after.
but some case need do that. 
5. shared object problem.some js-function shared object to work fast,sometime it'make problem.
if you found something,please post issue or pull request.

[Why Java?]
beside I'm not familiar with javascript.
I'm using GoogleAppEngine-Java on server-side.
Using Java only is effect on me.

however if you are new on GWT,I heavy recommend you use javascript.

[How to use]
1 .Don't use deprecated class,method.I'll remove soon.
2  Compile project,otherwise storm of errors show on gwt-console or too slow fps.
3 check origina js code.
4 use right three.js version(sadly sometime only work on old version)

[Tested on Stable-version]
BVH-Motion-Creator - https://github.com/akjava/BVH-Motion-Creator
BVHPoseEditor - https://github.com/akjava/BVH-Pose-Editor
GTHApe	- https://github.com/akjava/gthape
gwt-box2d-three-samples - https://github.com/akjava/gwt-box2d-three-samples


but sadly most most of package i never tested yet.
especially in extaras

[Developing cencept]
As possible as can follow latest version.
but sadly sometime i forgot it.

[Bug]
Sometime error happend on Developement Mode,compile and test on browser.

if method need  Array or Object parameters  ,and in inside it is using instanceof to parameter,it make a problem.
i heard some frame problem is there.(maybe linker option fix this problem)
for example in JSONLoader.js ,if url is object never called console.warn.
>THREE.JSONLoader.prototype.load = function ( url, callback, texturePath ) {
>var worker, scope = this;
>if ( url instanceof Object ) {  
>console.warn( 'DEPRECATED: JSONLoader( parameters ) is now JSONLoader( url, callback, texturePath ).' );

[Introduce pacakages]
com.akjava.gwt.three.client.js - basic as possible as can simply wrap three.js ;most of them extended JavaScriptObject
com.akjava.gwt.three.client.gwt - wrap js-object to easy access for java. most of them extended JavaScriptObject
com.akjava.gwt.three.client.java - some utils for non three.js codes.most of them pure java.
com.akjava.gwt.three.client.examples - some test for three.js examples codes but most of them now work fine so far.
com.akjava.gwt.threetest - test codes.
com.akjava.gwt.threecanvastest - canvastest . not update anymore.
